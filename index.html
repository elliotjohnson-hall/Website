                    <p>I'm an anatomist and developmental biologist by training
                        and I'm interested in tissue engineering. I'm particularly
                        fascinated by musculoskeletal tissues and the challenges
                        they present. My other passions include 3D printing, widening participation in higher education
                        &#38; science,
                        and
                        science communication.

                    <h2>Research statement</h2>
                    <p>I am about to start an MRes at the University of Bristol after graduating from the University of
                        Edinburgh with a BSc (Hons.) in Anatomy &#38; Developmental Biology. I'm looking for PhD
                        opportunites in tissue engineering, with a particular focus on osteochondral tissues and
                        osteoarthritis.</p>
                    <p>As an anatomist by training, I believe I bring a particular structured way of thinking about how
                        tissues assemble to the field of tissue engineering. Through my dissection-based experience, I
                        have
                        observed the complex architecture of the musculoskeletal system first-hand which has resulted in
                        my
                        keen interest in working within this emerging area. I am a particularly keen to work with
                        osteochondral tissues, both in health for in vitro models and in osteoarthritic diseased with a
                        view
                        to producing personalised, tissue-engineered constructs for implantation.
                        I am also fascinated by the possibilities of additive manufacturing and am a keen 3D printing
                        enthusiast. I used my experience with this technology to produce constructs with a dynamic
                        rigid-compliant interface for seeding with osteoblasts in the lab for my undergraduate project.
                        By
                        being able to design and produce prototypes rapidly, and iteratively I was able to achieve
                        tensile
                        properties similar to human tendons found in vivo. These skills, combined with my anatomy and
                        developmental biology experience leads me to believe I can offer a fresh perspective to the
                        field of
                        musculoskeletal tissue engineering.</p>

                        <h3>Multi-material 3D printing to mimic the osteo-tendinous enthesis</h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>This was my undergraduate dissertation project at the University of Edinburgh,
                        supervised by Dr Jennifer Paxton. I explored the use of flexible TPU and other rigid
                        plastics to mimic the interface between bone and tendon using 3D printing.
                        I then went further to examine if the constructs I produced could be used for tissue
                        engineering scaffolds.

                    <h3>The effects of Covid-19 restrictions on contraception in Scotland</h3>
                    <p>I'm currently working on a manuscript about the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent
                        restrictions
                        had on the prescribing of contraceptives in Scottish general practices. This is a retrospective
                        study looking at data between 2015 and 2023.

                    <h3>Development of an open-source, economical bioreactor for tendon extension <i>in vitro</i></h3>
                    <p>I am aiming to develop a cheap (less than Â£200) bioreactor concept based on an Arduino nano. This
                        project is designed
                        to overcome previous hurdles with economical bioreactors reported in the literature by using
                        readily-available parts and standard
                        cell culture plasticware. If successful, this could be useful for tendon tissue engineering
                        where
                        mechanical stress has been
                        shown to be vital for proper development.

                    <h2>Outreach work</h2>
                    <p>I'm passionate about making science more inclusive. During my time at the University
                        of Edinburgh I was a founding part of the STEM outreach society Hands-On! I served
                        as the secretary for the society during my final year and we managed to deliver
                        several sessions in local schools reaching hundreds of children. I'm also a STEM ambassador
                        looking for opportunities in Bristol and the surrounding area.

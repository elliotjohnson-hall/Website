## About me

I'm an anatomist and developmental biologist by training and I'm interested in tissue engineering. I'm particularly fascinated by musculoskeletal tissues and the challenges they present. My other passions include 3D printing, widening participation in higher education & science, and science communication.

## Research interests

- Musculoskeletal & osteochondral tissue engineering
- 3D cell culture
- Additive manufacturing
- Cell-instructive biomaterials
- Mechanobiology
- Interfacial tissue engineering

## Research statement

I am currently undertaking an MRes at the University of Bristol with the Armstrong Group after graduating from the University of Edinburgh with a First Class BSc (Hons.) in Anatomy & Developmental Biology. After this, I'll be joining the Snelling Group at the University of Oxford to undertake a DPhil in Molecular and Cellular Medicine.

As an anatomist by training, I believe I bring a particular structured way of thinking about how tissues assemble to the field of tissue engineering. Through my dissection-based experience, I have observed the complex architecture of the musculoskeletal system first-hand which has resulted in my keen interest in working within this emerging area. I am fascinated by the unique challenges presented by osteochondral tissues. My current work centres around high-concentration collagen and glycosaminoglycan hydrogels for articular cartilage regeneration.

## Current projects

###Â High-concentration collagen and glycosaminoglycan hydrogels for articular cartilage tissue engineering

This is my MRes project where we aim to produce high-concentration biomimetic hydrogels composed of type II collagen and glycosaminoglycans to recapitulate the architecture and properties of the extracellular matrix of native articular cartilage. If successful, this could be used for *in vitro* modelling, or as a stepping stone to a future biomaterial for cartilage repair.

### The effects of Covid-19 restrictions on contraception in Scotland

I'm currently working on a manuscript about the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions had on the prescribing of contraceptives in Scottish general practices. This is a retrospective study looking at data between 2015 and 2023.

## Previous projects

### [Multi-material 3D printing to mimic the osteo-tendinous enthesis](/pages/projects/enthesis-edinburgh)

This was my undergraduate dissertation project at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr Jennifer Paxton. I explored the use of flexible TPU and other rigid plastics to mimic the interface between bone and tendon using 3D printing. I then went further to examine if the constructs I produced could be used for tissue engineering scaffolds. I'm presenting this work at the 2023 Summer Meeting of the Anatomical Society in Bangor.

## Outreach work

I'm passionate about making science more inclusive. During my time at the University of Edinburgh I was a founding part of the STEM outreach society Hands-On! I served as the secretary for the society during my final year and we managed to deliver several sessions in local schools reaching hundreds of children. I'm also a STEM ambassador looking for opportunities in Bristol and the surrounding area.

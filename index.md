## About me

I'm an anatomist and developmental biologist by training and I'm interested in tissue engineering. I'm particularly fascinated by musculoskeletal tissues and the challenges they present. My other passions include 3D printing, widening participation in higher education & science, and science communication.

## Research interests

- Musculoskeletal & osteochondral tissue engineering
- 3D cell culture
- Additive manufacturing
- Bioinks & bioprinting
- Cell-instructive biomaterials
- Mechanobiology
- Interfacial tissue engineering

## Research statement

I am about to start an MRes at the University of Bristol after graduating from the University of Edinburgh with a BSc (Hons.) in Anatomy & Developmental Biology. I'm looking for PhD opportunites in tissue engineering, with a particular focus on osteochondral tissues and osteoarthritis.

As an anatomist by training, I believe I bring a particular structured way of thinking about how tissues assemble to the field of tissue engineering. Through my dissection-based experience, I have observed the complex architecture of the musculoskeletal system first-hand which has resulted in my keen interest in working within this emerging area. I am a particularly keen to work with osteochondral tissues, both in health for *in vitro* models and in osteoarthritic diseased with a view to producing personalised, tissue-engineered constructs for implantation. 

I am also fascinated by the possibilities of additive manufacturing and am a keen 3D printing enthusiast. I used my experience with this technology to produce constructs with a dynamic rigid-compliant interface for seeding with osteoblasts in the lab for my undergraduate project. By being able to design and produce prototypes rapidly, and iteratively I was able to achieve tensile properties similar to human tendons found *in vivo*. These skills, combined with my anatomy and developmental biology experience leads me to believe I can offer a fresh perspective to the field of musculoskeletal tissue engineering.

## Current projects

### [Multi-material 3D printing to mimic the osteo-tendinous enthesis](/pages/projects/enthesis-edinburgh)

This was my undergraduate dissertation project at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr Jennifer Paxton. I explored the use of flexible TPU and other rigid plastics to mimic the interface between bone and tendon using 3D printing. I then went further to examine if the constructs I produced could be used for tissue engineering scaffolds.

### The effects of Covid-19 restrictions on contraception in Scotland

I'm currently working on a manuscript about the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions had on the prescribing of contraceptives in Scottish general practices. This is a retrospective study looking at data between 2015 and 2023.

*Expected publication date: December 2023*

### Development of an open-source, economical bioreactor for tendon extension *in vitro*

I am aiming to develop a cheap (less than Â£200) bioreactor concept based on an Arduino nano. This project is designed to overcome previous hurdles with economical bioreactors reported in the literature by using readily-available parts and standard cell culture plasticware. If successful, this could be useful for tendon tissue engineering where mechanical stress has been shown to be vital for proper development.

## Outreach work

I'm passionate about making science more inclusive. During my time at the University of Edinburgh I was a founding part of the STEM outreach society Hands-On! I served as the secretary for the society during my final year and we managed to deliver several sessions in local schools reaching hundreds of children. I'm also a STEM ambassador looking for opportunities in Bristol and the surrounding area.
